h1. Todo

h2. Bugs

* FIXME: The 2/10/2009 raid parse displays a blank member with 100% attendance on the Raids#show page
** Could not duplicate

h2. Short term

* -Learn RSpec-
** -Convert tests to RSpec-
* -MemberRanks (prefix/suffix,- show/hide[?])
* -Item pricing from Wowhead based on item level and slot-
* -Find out how to allow /members/Tsigo AS WELL AS /members/1234-
* -Render (at the very least) /members/index as lua-

h2. Medium term

* -Convert production EQdkp database to Rails format-
** -Ensure data matches up- (through tests?)
* Administration
** New/Edit item pages
** Edit raid page

* Item Normalization
** If we rename an item, other items that used to have that name don't get renamed

h3. Interface Overhaul

* Find sites I like and try to replicate them
* Tabbed interface
** Needs at least two levels - We click 'Items' then we want to have a row for filters ('All', 'Normal', 'Best in Slot', 'Situational', 'Rot')
** ViewMember: Raids, Items, [Plugins: Wishlist/Achievements]; Should all be Ajax loaders
** ViewRaid: Attendees, Drops
* Glyph icons similar to IPBoard 3 for edit/delete inside each row
* Drop-down menu navigation system
* Column sorting (Javascript? We use pagination)

h2. Long term

* -Wowhead item lookup (@item_cache@ replica)-
* Users & Permissions
** 'My Standing' link dependant on login status and whether or not a member of that name exists?
** PLEASE try to make it hook into IPB's auth system, or at least write an auth system for IPB that writes user changes to the DKP side
* Wishlists
* Achievements
* Administration
** -Punishment system, for when we want to affect someone's loot factor without adding an item-
*** -Allow an expiry time-
** Logging ('Tsigo added a raid on 2009-01-01')
* Exception handling so people can't tell it's Rails (?)
