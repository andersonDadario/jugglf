h2. Priorities

On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is a feature that *has* to be complete before we can use the app in production
 
 2 Last Loot
 
 3 New/Edit rank interfaces
 3 Performance; caching
 3 Real-time raid and item logging (online JuggyAttendance replacement)
 3 Redesign interface to better fit with the forums (Redesign the forums, I say!)
 
 4 Comments, Admin notes
 
 5 Logging of actions
 5 Statistics - number of members, raids, items
 5 XML resources

h2. Bugs

* FIXME: Editing a wishlist item, and then clicking the button to add a new entry breaks the labels/autocomplete, because they're still going to the edit form.
* Items:
ActionView::TemplateError (String can't be coerced into Fixnum) on line #13 of app/views/items/index.html.haml:
10:     - @items.each do |item|
11:       %tr{ :class => cycle('even', 'odd') }
12:         %td= link_to_item_with_stats(item)
13:         %td= h(item.loots.size)
14:         %td= h(item.wishlists.size)
15: %br
16: = will_paginate @raids

h2. Short term

h2. Medium term

* Comments on stuff ('I was late for this raid and didn't send you a tell, please add me anyway?!')
** Admin note section ('Modrack needs his [Betrayer of Humanity] changed to BiS once 3.1 hits')

* Administration
** New/Edit Rank pages
*** Hide overrides Member.active ?
** Quick ItemPrice interface?

h3. Interface Overhaul

* Glyph icons similar to IPBoard 3 for edit/delete inside each row
* Navigation
** [Option] Drop-down menu navigation system
** [Option] Left-hand menu navigation
* Column sorting in spots where Javascript can't be used
** http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/SortHelper2

h2. Long term

* Administration
** Logging ('Tsigo added a raid on 2009-01-01')
