h1. Todo

h2. Priorities

On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is a feature that *has* to be complete before we can use the app in production
 
 1 Users/Permissions, attaching Members to Users
 
 2 Page titles
 2 Need to say "Hey, this site needs Javascript. You should turn that on."
 2 Last Loot
 2 Styled 404/exception pages
 2 Summary page; class counts, attendance averages, loot factor averages
 2 Search (for autocompleting Item name fields, going directly to member pages without knowing their ID)
 
 3 Achievements
 3 Edit Raid interface
 3 New/Edit Loot interfaces
 3 New/Edit Item interfaces (mostly to delete bogus items)
 3 New/Edit rank interfaces
 3 Performance; caching
 3 Real-time raid and item logging (online JuggyAttendance replacement)
 3 Redesign interface to better fit with the forums (Redesign the forums, I say!)
 3 Relative dates ("Falls off loot factor in x days"), "[Punishment] expires in 3 days")
 
 4 "Who's Online" list
 4 Comments, Admin notes
 4 Searching
 
 5 Logging of actions
 5 Statistics - number of members, raids, items
 5 XML resources

h2. Bugs

* FIXME: A styled button without an image isn't the same height as one with an image
* Wishlists > Naxx > Gluth has a nil.parent error
* Items:
ActionView::TemplateError (String can't be coerced into Fixnum) on line #13 of app/views/items/index.html.haml:
10:     - @items.each do |item|
11:       %tr{ :class => cycle('even', 'odd') }
12:         %td= link_to_item_with_stats(item)
13:         %td= h(item.loots.size)
14:         %td= h(item.wishlists.size)
15: %br
16: = will_paginate @raids

h2. Short term

h2. Medium term

* Comments on stuff ('I was late for this raid and didn't send you a tell, please add me anyway?!')
** Admin note section ('Modrack needs his [Betrayer of Humanity] changed to BiS once 3.1 hits')

* Administration
** New/Edit Item pages
** Edit Raid page
** New/Edit Rank pages
*** Hide overrides Member.active ?
** Quick ItemPrice interface?
* Search controller
** /search/:context/:query
*** /search/members/Tsigo takes me to Tsigo's page
*** /search/items/Warglaive gives me a list of items that match

h3. Interface Overhaul

* Glyph icons similar to IPBoard 3 for edit/delete inside each row
* Navigation
** [Option] Drop-down menu navigation system
** [Option] Left-hand menu navigation
* Column sorting in spots where Javascript can't be used
** http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/SortHelper2

h2. Long term

* Achievements
* Administration
** Logging ('Tsigo added a raid on 2009-01-01')
* Exception handling so people can't tell it's Rails (?)
