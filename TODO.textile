h1. Todo

h2. Bugs

* FIXME: The 2/10/2009 raid parse displays a blank member with 100% attendance on the Raids#show page
** Could not duplicate
* FIXME: A styled button without an image isn't the same height as one with an image

h2. Short term

h3. Item Normalization

If we rename an item, other items that used to have that name don't get renamed

* Rename 'Item' to 'Loot' - these are the actual loots people get, the items that drop on raids
** t.references :item
** drop 'name'
* Create 'Item', these are unique items that allow for normalizing the name
** belongs_to Drop

h2. Medium term

* Wishlists
* Users & Permissions
** 'My Standing' link dependant on login status and whether or not a member of that name exists?
** PLEASE try to make it hook into IPB's auth system

* Administration
** New/Edit Item pages
** Edit Raid page
** New/Edit Rank pages
*** Hide overrides Member.active ?
** Quick ItemPrice interface?
* Search controller
** /search/:context/:query
*** /search/members/Tsigo takes me to Tsigo's page
*** /search/items/Warglaive gives me a list of items that match

h3. Interface Overhaul

* Item type filters
** [Option] Make the 'Notes' value clickable to only show that type, and then put a 'clear' icon next to it?
* Glyph icons similar to IPBoard 3 for edit/delete inside each row
* Navigation
** [Option] Drop-down menu navigation system
** [Option] Left-hand menu navigation
* Column sorting where Javascript can't be used
** http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/SortHelper2

h2. Long term

* Achievements
* Administration
** Logging ('Tsigo added a raid on 2009-01-01')
* Exception handling so people can't tell it's Rails (?)
